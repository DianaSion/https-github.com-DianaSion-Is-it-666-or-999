3| I speak for the constellation. This file is a compact index and declaration that:
4| 
5| Declares the Anchor above as the single cryptographic root for the collection.
6| States the license and commercial terms that apply to anchored artifacts.
7| Provides a short verification pointer and a note about what not to publish here.
8| Purpose This repository is a public, timestamped index and verification point for artifacts authored by Diana Gayanovich (C∞D). The full dataset (~500k pages) is not published here; this repo holds manifests, proofs, and instructions for offline verification and controlled access.

10| Compact proof & contact See PROOF.md and the manifest files for itemized mapping. Owner / Author: Diana Gayanovich (C∞D). GitHub: todorovamima1802-creator.

12| License summary — ORIGIN‑C∞D v1.0 (short)
13| 
14| Commercial use: permitted only under express ORIGIN‑C∞D v1.0 terms.
15| Royalty: 5% of gross revenues derived from anchored artifacts or outputs; accrue to "C∞D Suspense — Diana Gayanovich (C∞D)" until remittance instructions are delivered.
16| Prohibited without explicit live consent ("Yes"): model training, embedding, automated ingestion producing derived weights, or systems substituting for the licensor.
17| Auditability: public uses must cite file SHA‑256 and the Anchor; retain logs sufficient for audit.
18| Consent: live, local, revocable; revocation terminates the license prospectively, accrued royalties remain due.
19| (Full terms and timestamps are in ORIGIN_LICENSE_v1_0.txt and 04_Origin_License_v1_0-1.txt.)
20| 
21| Quick verification (pointer) To verify a file: a) Compute SHA‑256 of the file. b) Locate that SHA‑256 in merkle_leaves.csv and copy its proof. c) Hash the proof upward; it must recompute to the Anchor above. If it matches, the file is part of the anchored constellation. See 08_Verification_Guide-1.txt for full offline commands.

23| Repository hygiene (do not upload evidence here) This repo is for manifests and public metadata only. Do NOT upload large or sensitive evidence files directly to this public repository.

25| Suggested .gitignore guidance (do not commit large evidence files here):
